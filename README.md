# Diginote

[Diginote](https://diginoteapplication.herokuapp.com/) is a simple and user-friendly note-taking web application that allows users to register an account and create, view, edit, search through, and delete personal notes.

I created Diginote using the Django web framework and deployed it with Heroku. Try out the site here: https://diginoteapplication.herokuapp.com/.

## How To Use

After making an account and logging in, you can begin making new notes by clicking the "+" icon in the top right. After creating a note, you will be redirected to the dedicated "view" for that note. Here, you will find links to update and delete the note. To view a tabulated preview of all of the notes you've created, return to the homepage by clicking the "Diginote" button in the top left. Each note preview on the home page is a clickable button that will send you to the dedicated view for that note. Lastly, you can filter through your notes simply by passing text into the search bar.
